djangoappengine - Django backends (DB, email, etc.) for App Engine
==================================================================

Djangoappengine contains App Engine backends for Django-nonrel, e.g. the database and email backends. In addition we provide a testapp_ which contains minimal settings for running Django-nonrel on App Engine. Use it as a starting point if you want to use App Engine as your database for Django-nonrel.
